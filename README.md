# CameraPlacement
Three Dimentional camera placement solution using Binary Integer Programming in MATLAB.

Enlightened by some previous work, this program uses Binary Integer Programming to model the AGP(Art Gallery Problem) and extend it to three dimentions to make it more practical in real world. To make it simple, I choose MATLAB for its convenient toolboxes, namely GA(Genetic Algorithm). The candidate camera is placed in certain height and the scene is designed by hand inspired by the cited paper.
